Abstract:
Develop a pseudocode for an algorithm; analyze your pseudocode mathematically; implement the code
for the algorithm of your choice; test your implementation; and describe your results.

Problem 1: Top k Most frequent elements

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the
answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: [1, 2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:
• 1 <= nums.length <= 105
• -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
• k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
• It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Your code should work for any input array. Try to solve it using priority queue as it gives better time
complexity in problems like this. But feel free to use any approach which is easy for you.
